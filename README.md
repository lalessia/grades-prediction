# High School Students' Grade Prediction

This repository contains a project focused on the exploration of data and prediction of academic grades for a sample of high school students. The data sources are extracted from Kaggle, and the project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling using Python.

## Project Structure

- **`dataset/`**: This folder contains the data sources used in the project. The datasets have been extracted from Kaggle and are utilized for both data exploration and modeling.

- **`grade_EDA_PDA.ipynb`**: This Jupyter Notebook is the core of the project. It includes:
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigation of the dataset to understand the distributions, relationships, and key patterns.
  - **Predictive Data Analysis (PDA)**: The application of machine learning models to predict students' grades based on the explored features.

- **`grade_documentation.pdf`**: This PDF document provides detailed documentation of the project, including the methodology, data processing steps, model selection, and evaluation.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need to have the following Python packages installed:

- matplotlib
- numpy
