# High School Students' Grade Prediction

This repository contains a project focused on data exploration and grade prediction for a sample of high school students, with the goal of identifying key factors influencing academic performance.

## Project Structure

- **`dataset/`**: This folder contains the data sources used in the project. The datasets have been extracted from Kaggle and are utilized for both data exploration and modeling.

- **`grade_EDA_PDA.ipynb`**: This Jupyter Notebook is the core of the project. It includes:
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigation of the dataset to understand the distributions, relationships, and key patterns.
  - **Predictive Data Analysis (PDA)**: The application of machine learning models to predict students' grades based on the explored features.

- **`grade_documentation.pdf`**: This PDF document provides detailed documentation of the project, including the methodology, data processing steps, model selection, and evaluation.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lalessia/students-grades-prediction.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd students-grades-prediction
```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook: You can open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
```bash
jupyter notebook grade_EDA_PDA.ipynb
```
4. Install requirements: You can install all the required packages using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Run the notebook: Execute the cells in the notebook to perform the data exploration and run the predictive models.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes information on various aspects of high school students, such as demographic details, alcohol consumption habits, and academic performance. 
The dataset has been preprocessed and is available in the dataset/ folder.
